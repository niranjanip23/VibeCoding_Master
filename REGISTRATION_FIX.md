# Registration Issue - RESOLVED ✅

## Problem Identified
The registration was failing with "BadRequest" because there was a mismatch between:
- **Frontend**: Sending only `Name`, `Email`, `Password` 
- **Backend**: Expecting `Username`, `Email`, `Password` (original DTO)
- **Database**: Requiring `Name`, `Username`, `Email`, `Password`, `Department` (User model)

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend Changes ✅
- **Updated RegisterDto** (`AuthDto.cs`):
  - Added `Name` field (required)
  - Added `Department` field (optional)
  - Kept existing `Username`, `Email`, `Password` fields

- **Updated AuthService.cs**:
  - Modified user creation to use `registerDto.Name` instead of `registerDto.Username` for name
  - Added `registerDto.Department` mapping

### 2. Frontend Changes ✅
- **Updated RegisterViewModel** (`User.cs`):
  - Added `Username` field (required)
  - Existing: `Name`, `Email`, `Department`, `Password`, `ConfirmPassword`

- **Updated ApiService**:
  - Modified `RegisterAsync` method signature to accept all 5 parameters
  - Updated request object to include all fields: `Name`, `Username`, `Email`, `Password`, `Department`

- **Updated IApiService interface**:
  - Modified interface to match the new method signature

- **Updated AccountController**:
  - Modified registration call to pass all required fields

- **Updated Register.cshtml**:
  - Added Username input field between Email and Password fields

### 3. Testing Results ✅
- **Backend API Direct Test**: ✅ Working - Registration successful with all fields
- **Frontend Form**: ✅ Ready - Form now includes all required fields
- **Error Handling**: ✅ Maintained - Still shows clear error messages

## Current Status
- **Backend**: Running on http://localhost:5031 ✅
- **Frontend**: Running on http://localhost:5000 ✅  
- **Registration API**: ✅ Working with all required fields
- **Registration Form**: ✅ Updated with Username field

## How to Test
1. Visit: http://localhost:5000/Account/Register
2. Fill in all fields:
   - Full Name: e.g., "John Doe"
   - Username: e.g., "johndoe123" 
   - Email: e.g., "john@example.com"
   - Department: e.g., "IT"
   - Password: e.g., "password123"
   - Confirm Password: e.g., "password123"
   - Check Terms agreement
3. Submit form
4. Should successfully create account and redirect to login

## Resolution
**The BadRequest error in registration has been FIXED** ✅

The issue was caused by incomplete field mapping between frontend and backend. All components now properly handle the complete user registration data including Name, Username, Email, Password, and Department fields.
