# QUESTION DETAILS VIEW FIX SUMMARY

## Problem Identified
After fixing the question creation issue, users reported a new error when accessing question details pages:

```
InvalidOperationException: The model item passed into the ViewDataDictionary is of type 'QueryHub_Frontend.Models.QuestionDetailViewModel', but this ViewDataDictionary instance requires a model item of type 'QueryHub_Frontend.Models.Question'.
```

## Root Cause
Model mismatch between the controller and view:
- **Controller** was returning `QuestionDetailViewModel` from `ApiService.GetQuestionAsync()`
- **View** (`Details.cshtml`) expected `Question` model
- Property names and structures were different between the two models

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated Details View Model Declaration
**Before:**
```cshtml
@model QueryHub_Frontend.Models.Question
```

**After:**
```cshtml
@model QueryHub_Frontend.Models.QuestionDetailViewModel
```

### 2. Updated Property References in View
- `CreatedDate` → `CreatedAt`
- `UserName` → `Author`
- `AnswerCount` → `Answers.Count`
- Removed `UpdatedDate` reference (not in ViewModel)
- Removed `UserAvatar` references (not implemented yet)

### 3. Fixed Backend Response Mapping
Updated `QuestionDetailApiModel` to match backend API response:
```csharp
// Before: Username, VoteCount
// After: UserId, Votes (matching actual backend response)
```

### 4. Enhanced ViewModels with Missing Properties
Added compatibility properties to `QuestionDetailViewModel` and `AnswerViewModel`:
```csharp
public List<string> TagList => Tags; // Alias for compatibility
public string UserName => Author; // Alias for compatibility
public DateTime CreatedDate => CreatedAt; // Alias for compatibility
public bool IsAccepted { get; set; } = false; // Placeholder
```

### 5. Temporarily Disabled Comments Feature
Comments functionality was causing compilation errors since:
- Backend doesn't include comments in API responses yet
- Comment models aren't properly defined
- Added comments to disable comment sections until properly implemented

## Files Modified
1. **Views/Questions/Details.cshtml** - Updated model declaration and property references
2. **Models/ViewModels.cs** - Added missing properties and aliases
3. **Services/ApiService.cs** - Updated `QuestionDetailApiModel` structure and mapping

## Current Status: RESOLVED ✅

**The question details view now works correctly:**
- ✅ Model mismatch resolved
- ✅ All property references fixed
- ✅ View loads without errors
- ✅ Question details display properly
- ✅ Navigation from question list to details works

## Temporarily Disabled Features
- **Comments** - Both question and answer comments are temporarily disabled
- **User Avatars** - Placeholder icons used instead of actual avatars
- **Answer Acceptance** - Not implemented in backend yet

## Testing Verified
- Question details page loads successfully
- Question information displays correctly
- No model binding errors
- Navigation flow works end-to-end

## Next Steps for Full Feature Completion
1. Implement comments in backend API
2. Add user avatar support
3. Implement answer acceptance functionality
4. Add proper error handling for missing questions
5. Re-enable comment features once backend supports them
