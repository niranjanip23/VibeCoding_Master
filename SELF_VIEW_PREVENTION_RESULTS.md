# Self-View Prevention Test Results

## Summary
✅ **SUCCESS**: Self-view prevention has been successfully implemented and tested!

## Test Results

### Backend Changes Made:
1. **Updated IQuestionService interface** to accept optional `currentUserId` parameter
2. **Modified QuestionService.GetByIdAsync()** to check if current user is question author
3. **Logic**: View count only increments if `currentUserId == null` OR `currentUserId != question.UserId`

### Test Scenarios Executed:

#### Test 1: Anonymous User Views
- **Expected**: View count should increment
- **Result**: ✅ PASS - View count incremented from 8 → 9 → 10

#### Test 2: Question Author Views Own Question  
- **Expected**: View count should NOT increment
- **Result**: ✅ PASS - View count stayed at 8 when user 1 (john) viewed question 31 (created by user 1)

#### Test 3: Different User Views Question
- **Expected**: View count should increment  
- **Result**: ✅ PASS - View count incremented from 8 → 9 when user 2 (jane) viewed question 31

#### Test 4: Multiple Self-Views
- **Expected**: Multiple self-views should not increment count
- **Result**: ✅ PASS - Second self-view kept count at 10

## Technical Implementation

### Interface Change:
```csharp
Task<QuestionDto?> GetByIdAsync(int id, int? currentUserId = null);
```

### Service Logic:
```csharp
public async Task<QuestionDto?> GetByIdAsync(int id, int? currentUserId = null)
{
    var question = await _questionRepository.GetByIdAsync(id);
    if (question == null) return null;

    // Only increment view count if the current user is not the question author
    if (currentUserId == null || currentUserId != question.UserId)
    {
        await _questionRepository.IncrementViewsAsync(id);
        // Fetch updated question
        question = await _questionRepository.GetByIdAsync(id);
        if (question == null) return null;
    }
    
    // ... rest of mapping logic
}
```

### Controller Usage:
```csharp
var currentUserId = GetUserIdFromClaims();
var question = await _questionService.GetByIdAsync(id, currentUserId);
```

## View Count Progression Example:
- Initial: 7 views
- Anonymous view: 8 views ✅
- Self-view (john): 8 views ✅ (no increment)
- Other user view (jane): 9 views ✅
- Anonymous view: 10 views ✅  
- Second self-view (john): 10 views ✅ (no increment)

## Benefits:
1. **Accurate Analytics**: View counts now represent genuine interest from other users
2. **Prevents Gaming**: Authors can't inflate their own question view counts
3. **Better User Experience**: More meaningful view statistics
4. **Maintains Compatibility**: Anonymous users and non-authors still increment normally

## Status: ✅ COMPLETED
The self-view prevention feature is fully implemented and working as expected!
